							special time is allocated for such integrated teaching in the
							timetable, every semester. Here, procedural skills are trained,
							repeatedly practiced, and evaluated until the required minimum
							standard for patient treatment is ensured. The students learn
							clinical skills in a structured step manner in small groups on
							Standardized Patients, Models, Mannequins, etc. They also learn to
							respond to clinical problems and apply their skills to solve them
							through simulations. Guided by the clinical skill demonstrators
							(facilitator) students meet the learning objectives. Small group
							demonstration and skill performance allow close monitoring of
							students and an objective assessment of skill acquisition.
